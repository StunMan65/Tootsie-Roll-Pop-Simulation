# Tootsie-Roll-Pop-Simulation
I simulated a the dissolving of a Tootsie Pop with math!

You will need the following Python libraries installed:
    · scipy
    · numpy
    · datetime
    · matplotlib
    · PIL (Pillow)

I also use the following libraries, but they come with Python, I think:
    · os
    · time
